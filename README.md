## A DSC80 Project


Electricity serves as a basis for satisfying fundamental human needs, such as food production, clean water, sanitation, education services, health care, and social services. When power outages occur, these fundamental human needs become at risk, which is something we want to minimize. In this project, we explored a data set that reports "major outages witnessed by different states in the continental U.S. during January 2000â€“July 2016." (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182#bib6).

The data features 1534 rows and 55 columns.
